### Phase 3: Advanced RAG (4-6 months)

#### Vector Search Over Course Materials
```python
# Example: Student asks about entropy
student_query = "Why does entropy always increase?"

# System searches across all physics course materials
vector_db.search(
  query=student_query,
  filters={"course": "Physics 101", "type": ["lecture", "textbook"]},
  top_k=5
)

# Returns most relevant chunks:
1. Lecture 12, Slide 8: "Second Law of Thermodynamics"
2. Textbook Chapter 7.3: "Entropy and Disorder"
3. Lecture 12 Transcript: Professor's explanation
4. Practice Problem Set 5: Example calculation
5. Lab Report 3: Entropy measurement experiment

# A★ Tutor uses these to formulate Socratic questions
# grounded in what student has actually studied
```

#### Multi-Modal Learning
- Parse and index PDF textbooks
- Extract content from video lectures
- Analyze images, diagrams, and equations
- Generate practice problems from lecture content

#### Citation Tracking
```
A★ Tutor: "According to what we covered in Lecture 12, 
           what happens to the entropy of an isolated system?"
           
[📚 Source: Lecture 12, Slide 8-10]
[📖 Related: Textbook Ch 7.3, Lab Report 3]
```

### Phase 4: Collaborative Learning (6-9 months)

#### Study Groups
- Find classmates working on same assignment
- Shared workspace for group projects
- AI moderates discussions to keep them Socratic
- Prevents answer-sharing while encouraging learning

#### Peer Teaching
```
Sarah (mastered Newton's Laws) ←→ AI ←→ Mike (struggling)
                                    ↓
AI facilitates Sarah explaining to Mike using Socratic method
Sarah reinforces her understanding by teaching
Mike gets peer perspective + AI guidance
Both learn more deeply
```

#### Course Communities
- Discussion forums per assignment
- AI surfaces common questions
- Creates study guides from collective queries
- Identifies trending topics for group review

### Phase 5: Instructor Dashboard (9-12 months)

#### Analytics for Educators
```

    → Students are engaging deeply - good assignment design!
```

#### Integration with LMS
- Instructors can see anonymized usage patterns
- Identify where students struggle most
- Adjust curriculum based on AI insights
- No student answers shared (privacy preserved)

### Phase 6: Adaptive Learning (Year 2)

#### Personalized Learning Paths
```
System learns over time:
  - Your learning style (visual, verbal, kinesthetic)
  - Optimal study times (morning person vs night owl)
  - Topics you master quickly vs need more time
  - Most effective question types for you
↓
Adapts teaching strategy:
  - More diagrams for visual learners
  - More word problems for verbal learners
  - Shorter sessions for easily distracted students
  - Deeper dives for curious, motivated students
```

#### Predictive Assistance
```
System notices patterns:
  - Student always struggles with Day 3 of assignments
  - Performance drops when assignments due near exams
  - Math anxiety before tests
↓
Proactive interventions:
  - "Hey, Day 3 - let's take this slow. What part are you working on?"
  - "I see you have an exam Friday and an assignment due Thursday. 
     Want to work on this assignment early?"
  - "Exam tomorrow? Let's do a confidence-building review."
```

## The Ultimate Workflow
