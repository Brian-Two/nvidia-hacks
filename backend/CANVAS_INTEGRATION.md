# Canvas MCP Integration Guide

## Overview

This document explains the Canvas MCP integration for A★ Tutor, which enables students to connect their Canvas LMS account to receive personalized help with assignments and exams using course materials as RAG context.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Canvas MCP Client** (`src/canvasMCP.js`)
   - Direct REST API integration with Canvas LMS
   - Singleton client pattern for efficient API usage
   - Handles authentication via Bearer token
   - Provides methods for all Canvas operations

2. **Canvas Tools** (`src/tools/canvasTools.js`)
   - Four main tools exposed to the LLM:
     - `list_upcoming_assignments`: Lists upcoming work across all courses
     - `get_course_materials`: Retrieves course content for RAG
     - `get_assignment_details`: Gets specific assignment information
     - `get_page_content`: Reads detailed page content

3. **Enhanced Graph** (`src/graph.js`)
   - Integrated Canvas tools into LangGraph workflow
   - Tools are automatically called by the LLM when needed
   - Results are passed back through the conversation flow

4. **Updated System Prompt** (`src/systemPrompt.js`)
   - Canvas-aware instructions for the LLM
   - Guidance on when and how to use Canvas tools
   - RAG-based teaching methodology

## Workflow

### User Experience Flow

```
Student runs: npm run canvas
↓
LLM calls: list_upcoming_assignments()
↓
Canvas API returns: All upcoming assignments with due dates
↓
LLM presents: Formatted list of assignments
↓
Student selects: "Help me with assignment #123"
↓
LLM calls: get_assignment_details(course_id, assignment_id)
↓
LLM calls: get_course_materials(course_id)
↓
Canvas API returns: Course syllabus, modules, pages
↓
LLM uses RAG: Grounds questions in actual course materials
↓
Socratic dialogue: Student thinks critically through the subject
```

### Technical Flow

## Canvas API Methods

### Course Operations

```javascript
canvasClient.getCourses()
// Returns all active courses for the user
// Includes enrollment info and total scores

canvasClient.getCourseSyllabus(courseId)
// Returns course name and syllabus HTML
// Used for high-level course overview

canvasClient.getCourseMaterials(courseId)
// Returns modules, pages, and files
// Core method for RAG context gathering

canvasClient.getCourseQuizzes(courseId)
// Lists all quizzes/exams in a course
```

### Assignment Operations

```javascript
canvasClient.getUpcomingAssignments(limit)
// Returns upcoming assignments across all courses
// Sorted by due date, filtered for future dates

canvasClient.getAssignmentDetails(courseId, assignmentId)
// Returns full assignment information
// Includes description, rubric, submission types

canvasClient.getSubmission(courseId, assignmentId, userId)
// Returns student's current submission status
// Shows score, attempt number, workflow state
```

### Content Operations

```javascript
canvasClient.getPageContent(courseId, pageUrl)
// Returns full HTML content of a page
// Used for accessing lecture notes and readings

canvasClient.getQuizDetails(courseId, quizId)
// Returns quiz/exam details
// Includes questions, time limit, attempts allowed
```

## RAG Implementation

### Current Approach

1. **Context Gathering**
   - Pull relevant course materials when student asks for help
   - Include syllabus, module content, and related pages
   - Limit initial data to prevent token overflow

2. **Context Usage**
   - LLM references course materials in its responses
   - Questions are grounded in what student has actually studied
   - Avoids hallucinating information not in the course

3. **Progressive Loading**
   - Start with assignment details and course overview
   - Pull specific pages only when needed for deeper dives
   - Use tool calls to fetch additional context on-demand

### Future Enhancements

- **Vector Embeddings**: Index all course materials for semantic search
- **Smart Chunking**: Break large documents into manageable chunks
- **Relevance Scoring**: Rank materials by relevance to current question
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed materials to reduce API calls
- **Multi-Course Context**: Handle questions spanning multiple courses

## Security & Privacy

### API Token Security

- Token stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- Token has read-only access to Canvas
- No data is sent to third parties
- All processing happens locally

### Data Handling

- Canvas data is fetched on-demand
- No persistent storage of course materials
- Student submissions are only accessed when explicitly requested
- API responses are used only for current session

### Best Practices

1. **Token Management**
   - Generate tokens with minimal required permissions
   - Rotate tokens periodically
   - Revoke tokens when no longer needed

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Canvas API has rate limits (~100 requests/10 seconds)
   - Client should implement backoff for failed requests
   - Batch requests when possible

3. **Error Handling**
   - All API calls wrapped in try-catch
   - Graceful fallbacks when Canvas is unavailable
   - Clear error messages for students

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Optional (with defaults)
CANVAS_API_URL=https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1
NV_API_KEY=your_nvidia_key
NV_MODEL=nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5
```

### Custom Canvas Instances

Many universities run their own Canvas instances:

```bash
# Example: University of XYZ
CANVAS_API_URL=https://canvas.xyz.edu/api/v1

# Example: State University
CANVAS_API_URL=https://su.instructure.com/api/v1
```

To find your instance URL:
1. Log into your Canvas
2. Look at the browser URL
3. Use that domain with `/api/v1` appended

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test Canvas connection
node src/main.js --mode=canvas --msg="Show my courses"

# Test upcoming assignments
node src/main.js --mode=canvas --msg="What assignments do I have?"

# Test assignment help
node src/main.js --mode=canvas --msg="Help me with my physics homework"

# Test course materials
node src/main.js --mode=canvas --msg="What topics are covered in my CS course?"
```

### Expected Behaviors

✅ **Success Cases:**
- Lists upcoming assignments with due dates
- Shows course names and assignment names
- Retrieves course materials when helping with assignments
- Asks Socratic questions based on course content

❌ **Error Cases:**
- Invalid token: "Canvas API token not configured"
- No courses: "No active courses found"
- API error: "Canvas API error: [status code]"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Canvas API token not configured"**
   - Check `.env` file exists
   - Verify `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` is set
   - Ensure no extra spaces or quotes

2. **"Canvas API error: 401"**
   - Token is invalid or expired
   - Generate new token from Canvas settings
   - Update `.env` with new token

3. **"No upcoming assignments found"**
   - Check you're enrolled in active courses
   - Verify assignments have due dates set
   - Ensure courses are published

4. **"Cannot read course materials"**
   - Course may restrict API access
   - Check Canvas course settings
   - Contact instructor about API permissions

### Debug Mode

Add logging to see API calls:

```javascript
// In canvasMCP.js
async makeRequest(endpoint, method = 'GET', body = null) {
  console.log(`[Canvas API] ${method} ${endpoint}`); // Add this
  // ... rest of method
}
```

### Tool Definitions

All tools follow OpenAI function calling format:

```javascript
{
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "tool_name",
    description: "What the tool does and when to use it",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { /* ... */ },
      required: [ /* ... */ ]
    }
  }
}
```
